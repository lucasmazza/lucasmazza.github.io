<img src='/public/me.jpg' class='headshot'> I'm a twenty-something years old human
from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I usually spend most of my days creating software with the
[Plataformatec](http://plataformatec.com.br) team, dealing with Ruby on Rails,
HTML & CSS, JavaScript and whatever may come.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lucasmazza) or check my
[projects and contributions on GitHub](https://github.com/lucasmazza).
