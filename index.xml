Um dos objetivos do design do ecto √© ser um &amp;ldquo;toolkit para mapeamento de dados&amp;rdquo; independente do uso de um banco de dados por de tr√°s dos panos, e nesta palestra vamos ver alguns casos de uso de schemas e changesets em situa√ß√µes diferentes de aplica√ß√µes onde um banco de dados n√£o est√° presente mas o ecto nos ajuda a resolver problemas no dia a dia.</description>

Feature toggles s√£o uma t√©cnica muito vers√°til para ajudar o trabalho de disponibilizar novas funcionalidades em produ√ß√£o sem quebrar a experi√™ncia de clientes e fazer entregas graduais, mas acabamos aprendendo sobre toggles de uma forma superficial no dia a dia.
Vamos ver um pouco do passado e presente do uso de features toggles, a sua facilidade de uso gra√ßas a ferramentas open source e considera√ß√µes a serem feitas sobre como e quando usar toggles na sua aplica√ß√£o</description>

Escrever testes autom√°ticos √© uma pr√°tica bem estabelecida na comunidade Ruby, mas o qu√£o bons s√£o os testes que escrevemos? Na correria do dia a dia, estamos testando de forma efetiva ou s√≥ escrevendo mais c√≥digo? Nesta palestra vamos ver alguns v√≠cios e m√°s pr√°ticas tradicionais de projetos Ruby, como podemos evit√°-los e escrever testes melhores, e quais mudan√ßas de pensando e pr√°ticas podemos adotar para aprimorar a nossa escrita de testes de software.</description>

      <description>Git has become an indispensable tool of software development, regardless of which language or framework your team uses it. But in the other hand, it isn&amp;rsquo;t a tool that you can adopt, learn and be effective from day 1 - it takes time and guidance to master it, both in the command line the integrations and practices most teams have adopted.
I&amp;rsquo;ve put up together a guide on how I see and use git on my day to day work, that can be used as a starting both for both newcomers who are trying to grok or more experienced professionals who want to make a more effective use of it on they work.</description>

      <title>The Zen and Art of Refactoring</title>

      <description>RubyConf Brazil 2016
Refactoring is often seen as a process where we make bad code better by waving our wands and casting our secret spells while facing our editors, which usually happens when things are on fire and the pressure is on. Changing software should be easier and not scary, and one of the first steps to do it is not to try to write future-proof code, but we can adopt different steps to think about the changes we want to do and how we can do them.</description>

Minitest nasceu como uma alternativa ao test/unit do Ruby 1.8 e se tornou um framework de testes extremamente robusto e ao mesmo tempo simples, e est√° dispon√≠vel em qualquer instala√ß√£o de Ruby hoje em dia, para todos escrevem testes sem muita burocracia.</description>

      <description>A few months back, Jos√© Valim started a conversation on overusing mocks and coupling between components. That made me interested on revisiting how I design my code and it has changed my approach to testing a bit in one of our current Ruby projects.
A Tale of Two Adapters Back in November, I worked on integrating a payment gateway from scratch into one of our client projects, through a gem that abstracts the HTTP interface of this external service.</description>

      <title>Books from 2015</title>

      <description>2015 was the first year that I had a New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve resolution to do: to read more books. I&amp;rsquo;m used to read a lot of blog posts and articles online but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t reading much outside of it (and most of what I was reading was strictly related to Rails and Front end anyway), so I set a goal of 12 books, technical or not, for 2015.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got it Close Enough‚Ñ¢ - 10 books in 12 months, and half way through the eleventh one.</description>

      <description>Predicting the future is hard, yet programmers like to repeat that Framework X or Language Y is the future of programming, the savior of all large scale projects and complex refactorings, and everything else is outdated, unfashion and awful (I‚Äôve seen this with most client side frameworks, a dozen of programming languages and a couple of times when someone decided to dig deep on functional programming). But as our small history on dealing with computers can show us, reality doesn‚Äôt work like that.</description>

      <description>Over the last couple weeks I decided to get back to watching videos from conference talks, old and new, to deal with matters of the heart and help with some of the ongoing discussions in the current project I&amp;rsquo;m working on.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of non technical presentations that talked about we can improve the ways we make software and deal with code rather than just dumping new technologies and going through README sections.</description>

      <title>Sane usage of Custom Elements</title>

      <description>Web Components have been an controversial subject that surfaced in the Front end world over the last years that I&amp;rsquo;m still pretty skeptical about its usage on existing and greenfield projects due the lack of good examples on how they can be rolled out to production, but I believe there is a way to get started with them without buying in all the hype.
The whole Web Components spec holds four different standards, but the Custom Elements has some interesting features that can be useful to a lot of common tasks from regular projects.</description>

      <title>Nobody told me Minitest was this fun</title>

      <description>Ever since I started working with Ruby I have been using RSpec to test my apps and gems without giving minitest much thought. Recently I started a new non-Rails project and decided to give Minitest a try just for the fun of it. Migrating from one tool to another was refreshingly fun due to the fact that that Minitest and RSpec aren&amp;rsquo;t so different from each other - they both have the basic features that we need in a testing library to get things running, and if you are used to testing your code moving from one to the other might not be so scary as you might expect.</description>

      <title>CSS at Plataformatec</title>

      <description>Last month some amazing developers gave a sneak peek on how they write CSS in their companies - Mark Otto has written about CSS at GitHub, followed by Ian Feather&amp;rsquo;s post about Lonely Planet&amp;rsquo;s CSS and Chris Coyier write up about CodePen&amp;rsquo;s code - so I thought about sharing a bit of how we have been doing CSS in our projects here at Plataformatec over the last years.
After working on different projects with different styles of CSS, we wrote some Guidelines of what kind of code we would like to work with.</description>

      <title>3 features from Rails 4.1 that I&#39;m excited about</title>

      <description>Rails 4.1 was just released this week and I already had a great experience trying out the release candidates on my latest project, so I decided to write a bit about my favorites features on this release and some things I have learned by using them so far.
1) secrets.yml Placing your configuration in a YAML file isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a revolutionary feature, but the usage of the config/secrets.yml file that comes with Rails 4.</description>

      <description>We have a gem available for every kind of feature or scenario we might face in our applications and that may help us focus our development time on things that are more important to our applications. But, every now and then, these packaged solutions aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly what we need, and some sort of customization needs to be done on top of that - a different authentication strategy, new ways to query for data and several different things that our business rules might require.</description>

      <description>Besides the big and shiny features that Rails 4 holds, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of small improvements on several other sections of the Rails framework - helpers, core extensions, app configurations and more - that might not even hit the Changelogs but will somehow make our lifes easier in the future. One of these hidden gems that I&amp;rsquo;ve found recently is an improvement on the content_for helper to flush and replace previous chunks of HTML with new ones.</description>
