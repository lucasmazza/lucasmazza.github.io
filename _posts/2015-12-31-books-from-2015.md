title: Books from 2015
description: The stuff I've read on 2015
---

2015 was the first year that I had a New Year's Eve resolution to do: to read
more books. I'm used to read a lot of blog posts and articles online but I wasn't
reading much outside of it (and most of what I was reading was strictly related to
  Rails and Front end anyway), so I set a goal of 12 books, technical or not,
  for 2015.

I've got it Close Enoughâ„¢ - 10 books in 12 months, and half way through the
eleventh one. I focused on fiction and YA titles, for a necessary break from
consuming only technical content over the last years.

Here is what I have been reading over this year:

### ðŸ“š [Notes of a Dirty Old Man](http://www.amazon.com/Notes-Dirty-Old-Charles-Bukowski/dp/0872860744) and [Women](http://www.amazon.com/Women-A-Novel-Charles-Bukowski/dp/0061177598), <small>by Charles Bukowski</small>

### ðŸ“˜ [Chasers of the Light](http://tylerknott.com/chasers) <small>by Tyler Knott Gregson</small>

A lightweight and lovely collection of poems. There isn't much to be said about
Tyler's work that would capture the feelings that his work might invoke in the
reader.

His [Tumblr](http://tylerknott.com/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tylerknott/)
feeds are an never ending source of more poems and haikus that can be a poignant
escapade from the routine of cat vines and food pictures.

### ðŸ“š [The Fault in Our Stars](http://johngreenbooks.com/the-fault-in-our-stars/), [Paper Towns](http://johngreenbooks.com/paper-towns/) and [Looking for Alaska](http://johngreenbooks.com/looking-for-alaska/), <small>by John Green</small>

John Green does an amazing job writing YA fiction that transcends the teenage
settings of their stories with deep insights and positivism that some "coming
of age" stories lack so much. If you believe it might be too cheesy for ya,
it might still be worth a read.

The movie adaptations for [The Fault in Our Stars](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582846)
and [Paper Towns](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3622592/) are true to their source
material

Also, John's (and Hank's, his brother) [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers)
is awesome.

### ðŸ“˜ [The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring](http://www.amazon.com/The-Fellowship-Ring-Being-First/dp/0618574948) <small>by J R R Tolkien</small>

I've watched the movies a bazilion times, but the LoTR books have been sitting on
my bookstand for a few years now - Tolkien ain't easy for the ones with short
attention spams.

### ðŸ“˜ [Show Your Work!](http://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/), <small>by Austin Kleon</small>

Austin's first book, [Steal Like an Artist](http://austinkleon.com/steal/), was
a great eye opener on creative process for non creative-ish people, and _Show Your Work_
feels like a sequel that talks about exposing and promoting your work and process.
Perfect for saving yourself from the boredom of a 2 hours flight or similar.

### ðŸ“˜ [If You Feel Too Much](https://twloha.com/ifyoufeeltoomuch/), <small>by Jamie Tworkowski</small>

[TWLOHA](https://twloha.com)'s origin is a great story of love and hope from 2006,
but what I find the most amazing is how that story is still alive through the
organization and Jamie's story, and we have a glimpse of his life and heart
throughout the book, the ups and downs, the good and the hard moments.

### ðŸ“˜ [Open](http://www.amazon.com/Open-What-Happens-Honest-Accountable/dp/1400205301), <small>by Craig Gross & Adam Palmer</small>

_Open_ took me more than an year to chew and finish it up. The takes a complete
tour on addressing accountability, the inner values of openness and the how-tos
to be a part of an accountability group and so on. Even if you don't intent to
go all the way on the path that Craig suggests, the book is a pint of renewed
honesty that you might find it handy.

The unfinished eleventh entry to the list is [Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking](http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153)
by Susan Cain, a great book on the introversion/extrovesion subject, packed with
interesting stories and research data.

## 2016

I plan to maintain the 12 books goal for next year. Pushing it to 15 or 20 would
be foolish and I doubt that I can upgrade my reading habits so much, but I hope
that I can hit the 12 books goal instead of getting so close like this year.
