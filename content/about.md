## I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and I work with web development

I have experience doing consulting projects and product development with both [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org)
and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and a deep interest on making development work
easier through automation, development tools and monitoring.

Outside of work you can find me enjoying specialty coffee, cooking and some casual
gaming sessions.

#### Senior Software Engineer, 11/2020 - Present - <small>SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil / Remote</small>

I'm helping Remote rapid growth through working on new features from different product areas,
recruiting and onboarding new engineers and advocating for developer experience and platform
stability as we expand into multiple countries and business verticals. 

I worked on product areas like in app and email notification foundations, built support for 2FA authentication for users and rolled out SSO capabilities for customers and internal users of our platform.

#### Senior Software Engineer and Team Leader, 2017 to 2020 - <small>SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil / Remote</small>

As a Software Engineer, I've helped to adopt [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org)
for new systems, improve our Kubernetes clustering setup and level up the code
review practices of the engineering team.

Later, as the Team Leader of the Platform team, I worked on projects improving
the integration between our product and [Easynvest](https://easynvest.com.br),
while laying ground work of our own investment broker system. The team went from
2 full time engineers to 8 people working on Elixir and Kubernetes to put the
new services online and Ruby to integrate with the existing user facing application.

#### Software Developer, 2012 to 2017 - <small>SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil</small>

At Plataformatec I worked on consulting projects involving greenfield development
of new Ruby on Rails systems and maintenance on apps requiring new features,
performance work and version upgrades. As the company grew over the years, I've
participated on planning and execution of our recruiting expansion and the mentoring
of new hires on Ruby, JavaScript and Git.

I was involved on the maintenance and ownership of the company open source libraries,
[Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) and [Simple Form](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form),
and also had the opportunity of creating new projects like the [Faraday HTTP Cache](https://github.com/sourcelevel/faraday-http-cache) gem.

I've bootstraped an internal tool called Ebert that was spun into its own product,
[SourceLevel](https://sourcelevel.io), working on development, infrastructure
customer support for the product by myself for almost an year.
