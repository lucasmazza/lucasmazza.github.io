**RubyConf Brazil 2016**

> Refactoring is often seen as a process where we make bad code better by waving
> our wands and casting our secret spells while facing our editors, which usually
> happens when things are on fire and the pressure is on.
> Changing software should be easier and not scary, and one of the first steps
> to do it is not to try to write future-proof code, but we can adopt different
> steps to think about the changes we want to do and how we can do them.
> In this talk we will discuss how we can approach the code to-be-changed and
> see our refactoring tasks as a common transformation process instead of a
> rescue mission and different questions we should ask ourselves before picking
> Design Patterns or architectural jargon for the changes we want to do on our software.
