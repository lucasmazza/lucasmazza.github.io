conference: ['RubyConf Brazil 2016']

> Refactoring is often seen as a process where we make bad code better by waving our wands and casting our secret spells while facing our editors, which usually happens when things are on fire and the pressure is on.
> Changing software should be easier and not scary, and one of the first steps to do it is not to try to write future-proof code, but we can adopt different steps to think about the changes we want to do and how we can do them.
> In this talk we will discuss how we can approach the code to-be-changed and see our refactoring tasks as a common transformation process instead of a rescue mission and different questions we should ask ourselves before picking Design Patterns or architectural jargon for the changes we want to do on our software.
