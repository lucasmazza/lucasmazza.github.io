> Scale a development team ain't an easy task, and it should be done by the team members themselves. I want to talk about how our team has grown over the last years and what we are doing to keep the company as the best workplace we can get, and how our routine exceeds the working hours and affect our lives.

> From our development workflow to the tools we use everyday, we are constantly revisiting our practices and adjusting them as we need, bringing new ideas and concepts to ensure that our team stays fresh and able to deliver great projects to our clients.
