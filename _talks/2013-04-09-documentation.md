>Good documentation will save you any day of the week, but yet a lot of developers dismiss the importance of writing it. Either documenting the source code of your gem or sharing the knowledge of how your dev team does its job can improve the communication among your coworkers or the ones looking forward to contribute to your code on GitHub. We are going to go through some examples of different well documented projects, what that brings to the table and stories of documentation in some projects from my last year at Plataformatec.
